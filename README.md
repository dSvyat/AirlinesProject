# AirlinesProject
Spring security/boot project

This project is based on Spring Security, where you, as a user, can log in/sign up, buy tickets, edit your account details, etc. As an admin, you can additionally manage planes by creating or editing them.
The planes for tickets are chosen randomly, and if you delete a plane associated with a ticket, a new plane will be automatically chosen for that ticket. SQL code for creating tables and inserting admins you can find in src/main/java/ua/vozniuk/AirlinesProject/sql/sql.
